# Physics-Scientific-Calculator
 Welcome to my calculator!
Here we will discuss analytically what is really exactly Physics Scientific-Calculator,how it works, how to download it and how to use itðŸ¤”.
# What is Physics Scientific-Calculator
 First things first.
Physics Scientific-Calculator is a ðŸ†“Free Open Source Programme made in C++ which has dozens of Physics equations that can be solved in a few milliseconds. It contains a lot of ðŸ”­Physics concepts which are: Kinematics, Gravity Dynamics, Linear Dynamics, Rotational Dynamics, Ballistics, Astrodynamics/OrbitalMechanics. Each one of these Physics concepts contains from 1 or more equations that you can choose to let the calculator do the job pretty fast. The equations you can solve with the calculator are not limited on the level of difficulty as it can solve simple ones such as the Velocity one or harder and more advanced like The N-Body Problem.
# How the Physics Scientific-Calculator works
 The calculator works by asking the user for input, then it takes user input, after that the input is stored in variables that then the variables are called to perform the calculation of the input and then it outputs the equation used, follows the equation again but with the input of the user and then it outputs the result.
# How to download the Physics Scientific-Calculator
 To download it you can see a greenðŸŸ¢ button on the right side of your screen nearby the "Go to file" search bar and the "Add fileâ†“" button, saying "<> Code â†“". ðŸ‘‰Click itðŸ‘ˆ. Then a new small box will appear with 2 tabs that you can choose from. The Local one which is the standard one and the Codespaces one.
 We will stay at the Local tab and download it from there. Near the down edge of that box you can click a button saying "Download ZIP" which also has a file with a zipper icon on its left. Click that too and your download will be started. When the download is done unzip it and you are ready to use itðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥!!!.
# How to use the Physics Scientific-Calculator
 To use it open the Physics Scientific-Calculator folder and there you can find a file called Physics Scientific-Calculator.exe. Run thatðŸš€. When the application launches you will be able to see some numbers and text like this: "[1] Astrodynamics". Choose the Physics' concept that the equation you are having trouble with matches. After you do so a new "[Number] text" like will appear. Choose the equation. Input the variables that the app asks you and your problem is solved like that.
